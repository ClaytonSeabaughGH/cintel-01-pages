# GitHub Pages

My first website using Markdown and GitHub Pages.

## Links 

Here's a clickable link: [My favorite Musician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_(Irish_musician))

## Images

Images look like links except with an exclamation directly in front

## Reminders

Use a dash space for unordered lists

- Spaces matter

- Spelling matters

- Capitalization matters
